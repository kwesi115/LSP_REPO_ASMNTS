For this assessment, I used AI mainly as a learning and organization tool. I asked for help understanding the requirements of each question, structuring my code correctly, and making sure my explanations were clear and professional. The AI helped me check for syntax errors, improve formatting, and verify that my answers met the assignmentâ€™s instructions. I also used it to reword some responses so they sounded more like my natural writing style. Even though the AI provided guidance, I reviewed and edited all of the work myself to make sure everything reflected my own understanding and ideas.
